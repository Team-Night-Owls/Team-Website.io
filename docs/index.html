                            <p>It has made me reflect on certain aspects I recognise in myself and created more awareness of the way I behave. 
                                Perhaps when I recognise certain traits (in action) I'll take note of it and try to correct any negative behaviours. 
                                It will also make me reinforce positive behaviours I can display. Mediators value input from everyone and encourage people to share their ideas. 
                                I think this is a great benefit to any team.</p>

                            <p>As I completed each of these personality tests, I noticed I seemed to be getting results that seemed pretty consistent with each other. 
                                My results showed that I was someone who looked out for other people and ensured that they were happy and comfortable, often putting their needs ahead of my own. 
                                These results, more or less, showed me what I already new. As the oldest child, I took it as my responsibity to make sure my younger siblings were happy and safe. 
                                I believe that this has been something I've carried throughout my life to the people around me.</p>

                                evaluation that if you have different learning behaviours in a group then the group should
                                function better. If they are the same, then the thought patterns and ideas tend to be related and
                                your do not get differing perspectives to problems and processes.</p>

                            <p>According to the results I am a diplomat who is good at listening and making connections. This means I have the potential to be a good project team leader. 
                                I feel as this is correct as when I do work in team environments, I often try to be the team leader because I know what builds a strong team and how to effectively 
                                delegate tasks to different members based on their strengths and weaknesses. When forming a team, I like to consider all member’s strengths and weaknesses. 
                                This helps build a team that thinks as one but comes at the project from different angles.</p>

                                I do think that being more of a tactile learner could be a challenge, especially online where I will have to mostly remain seated at my computer desk and discuss 
                                ideas/projects through discord or zoom. I also tend to get bored when working on the same issue for long periods of time, with no significant change, 
                                which can also make working in teams a bit of a struggle when I find it harder to assist on certain issues that aren't being resolved. However, with the help of my 
                                fellow team members I'm sure that we can push through these smaller issues and focus on the goal we want to achieve.</p>

            <p>Michael Oldham currently works as a consultant/developer for the largest consulting arm of Telstra known as Telstra Purple. 
                Mr Oldham designs and deploys contact centres for use by external customers. The type of contact centre can range from either 
                a web chat system, a phone call service, both of which help the customers get in contact with the support team. He has also 
                worked on an outbound dialler that connects agents to a list of answered phone calls.</p>
            <p>Within Telstra itself, Mr. Oldham works with people from all over the world all with a variety of different skill sets. 
                Working together to deliver a product that meets the needs of their clients.</p>
            <P>Below I have outlined some of the challenges Mr. Oldham faces in his line of work and the ways he has had to adapt to the current pandemic. 
                Mr. Oldham touched on some of the challenges of working remotely and how the need to go into an office has become non-existent. 
                Along with team collaboration, deadlines etc.</P>
            <p>With the obvious challenges imposed by covid 19 restrictions, not being able to work directly with the client can cause a lot of challenges. 
                Typically Mr. Oldham finds that in order to collect the requirements needed by the client it is sometimes better to be done in person. 
                The example he gives is that he finds it difficult to read the body language when it is done over video call. 
                He mentions that body language is a great indication of whether someone has understood what you have been explaining to them. 
                Being able to adjust your communication skills to be understood by a range of clients is also a challenge.</p>
            <p>He finds that when discussing these things with either supervisors or agents, a lot of the time, while they have 
                highly regarded skills in other areas, they are not technically minded. On the other hand, he may also find himself 
                in a discussion with a data analyst who is very technically minded. He goes on to mention, developing this soft skill 
                is crucial to the communication between himself and the clients.</p>
            <p>Being able to identify a way of communicating clearly with the client is integral to the success of the project. 
                An example that Mr. Oldham gave on how he might handle these kinds of challenges is that when the language barrier is tough, 
                the use of a whiteboard has been very effective in communicating with the client.</p>
            <p>Besides discussing requirements with clients to help design these systems, Mr.Oldham also has to build them. 
                He goes on to mention that writing the code for these applications is quite easy and straightforward. 
                It’s the exception handling aspect where he finds a lot of his time is spent. Putting processes in place 
                for every possible scenario is very time consuming and a vital part of the design process to minimise the 
                potential for things to go wrong.
                This is where time management becomes tricky. Mr. O
                ldman mentions it's a balancing act to keep within 
                the time constraints and produce the best version of the system you can within that time frame.</p>
            <p>The pressure to keep to a time frame creates friction between everyone working within the project. Just like 
                with most things problems are going to arise, aspects of the design will be overlooked and this can be costly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Oldham gave the group an excellent insight into what a consultant/developer working for a major telecommunications 
                company can expect to face day to day. Working in IT has its challenges and it is by no means a 9-5 type of job, 
                however it has and continues to be a fun and rewarding career.</p>

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that currently equips machines with 
                    the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human all languages. It combines the field of linguistics and 
                    computer science to decipher language structure guidelines and to make models which can comprehend, break down and separate 
                    significant details from text and speech. Humans interact with each other on a daily basis, for example over social media platforms, 
                    transferring large quantities of freely available data to each other. This data is extremely useful for NLP in understanding human behaviors 
                    and the habits of its customers.</p>
                <p>Most recently, data analysts tend to use the entirety of this data to give machines the ability to mimic human communication behaviors. 
                    This currently saves companies a significant amount of man power and time, as they no longer need to have a person present at the other end 
                    of the phone to be able to assist a customer with an issue. NLP can be applied every day in many different situations, for example when you are 
                    unsure of the spelling of a certain word, Autocorrect steps in to resolve this issue in a very convenient manner. Additionally, if a term paper was 
                    flagged for potential plagiarism, there are a vast number of online plagiarism checkers that can check for matches with your documents from all over the web.</p>
                <p>Future directions of this field of technology include:
                    <br> - Enhanced interpretability (Zhang et al., 2021): this development is becoming increasingly important as technology generates more complex models and programs. 
                    Interpretability allows computers to effectively analyse and evaluate models for specific purposes. 
                    <br> - Emotional detection and conveyance (Strapparava, 2016): the ability to interpret and convey emotion can facilitate the human connection aspect of this technology. 
                    As the basic purpose of NLP is to derive meaning in human communication, the ability to evaluate syntactic and semantic features will be enhanced with this additional layer 
                    of consideration. For example, emotions can impact on more subtle aspects of communication, such as implied meanings and sarcasm. 
                    <br> - Clinical applications in medicine (Nehme & Feldman, 2020): This is an exciting direction that will likely develop a major role in different medical industries. 
                    This paper illustrated an early example, where NLP is being used to facilitate the translation of research to clinic practice in the field of gastroenterology, in particular 
                    for complex surgical procedures.</p> 
                <p>There are several important advances in technology that have enabled NLP in the past, and will continue to support its evolution:
                    <br> - Word-sense disambiguation – being able to discern the sense of a word, as it is used in a particular sentence. This has implications for discourse and the relevance of search engines.  
                    <br> - Part of speech tagging Parsing – to analyse the grammar, speech and syntactic relations in a sentence, as well as being able to describe a word in the sentence. 
                    <br> - Spam detection – a series of filters are used to generate a binary classification of emails as relevant or spam, and consequently being able to direct them into a spam folder. 
                    <br> - Sentiment detection – this form of analysis is a foundational component of natural language processing, and enables a computer to be able to identify and extract opinions within any given text. 
                    <br> - Named entity recognition – this process enables a computer to detect any important names (for people, organisations, brands etc) that are mentioned in a text, and thus be able to sort additional 
                    information into relevant and extraneous streams. 
                    <br> - Coreference resolution – Finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a string of text (e.g., identifying the named subject and any further referents via the use of pronouns)
                    <br> - Question-answering Information extraction – there are several approaches to this component, including knowledge based and information retrieval based processes. These paradigms allow a computer 
                    to analyse the question, retrieve any relevant information and generate appropriate answers 
                    <br> - Dialogue – these systems function to enable conversation with humans, as they employ one of various communication modes on both input and output channels
                    <br> - Machine translation – being able to automatically convert one natural language into another, whilst avoiding any deviations in the semantics features of the text 
                    <br> - Paraphrasing and summarising technology – this is a discourse level of analysis, that requires in-depth analysis of text components and overall main ideas (Ferrari, 2018).</p>
                <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <p>A large recent impact of NLP has been in its involvement in COVID-19. With the world plunged into a worldwide pandemic, there has been immense documentation regarding the spread of the virus, diagnosis 
                    and testing procedures/protocols. With a vast increase in use of medical terminology by the media, and in all the documentation of COVID-19, NLP has been used to update the public’s understanding of the 
                    current risks and restrictions.</p>
                <p>Health care workers have been required to complete additional tasks in their practices, including the documentation of patient personal details and implementation of other government mandated protocols 
                    (such as use of QR codes). The extraction of this information supports the government to achieve quality reporting, risk stratification, medical necessity reviews and predictive analyses.</p>
                <p>Clinical NLP is a specialization of NLP that allows computers to understand the rich meaning that lies behind a doctor's written analysis of a patient. Wolters Kluwer’s Clinical NLP is one of many CNLP 
                    that optimizes and accelerates medical record reviews.</p>
                <p>With the ever-evolving nature of natural language processing it will only continue to grow and become more advanced as we as do as a society. With this will bring new jobs in sectors such as data analysis, 
                    computer scientists and even potentially more linguistic based jobs, such as speech pathologists, by increasing our own understanding of language.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, these developments will also likely make many jobs redundant, such as company helpline centres. There are many jobs and services that may have previously been accepted as requiring a 
                    human to manage the responsibilities, however this may be changing as computers are becoming increasingly able to analyse patterns in and imitate human behaviours. NLP appears to be breaching the barrier 
                    between human services and computer services, and therefore impacting our understanding of what it means to be human.</p>
                <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
                <p>As described above, NLP has vast and significant impacts in our world today. It has integrated into many aspects of our lives, practically every aspect that is already influenced by digital technology. 
                    NLP has made most forms of technology more accessible to the public, especially those who are less familiar or confident with using technology. For many older men and women, digital technology is a 
                    foreign and challenging concept, and they often ask for help in setting up and using new devices. However, as NLP has generated software like Siri, older generations are often able to ask questions 
                    and comprehend the more accessible language used to navigate new devices.</p>
                <p>NLP also enables easier access to troubleshooting pages. For example, when my grandmother first started using her iPad, she accidentally changed the language and couldn’t figure out how to change 
                    it back to English. Being unfamiliar with how settings usually works, she relied on Siri to change the language.</p>
                <p>For me personally, I use social media for many different purposes, including social relationships, updates on news events, and learning new skills through video tutorials. NLP is evident in 
                    a number of functions on Facebook. For example, when searching for a friend or a particular group, I can enter a relevant word and Facebook is able to find semantically related name to 
                    match my search. It is also commonly understood that social media platforms process any information we provide and analyse to form an online profile that generates content that is 
                    targeted towards our interests and demographic.</p>

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>There are six (6) different levels of autonomy according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) (“The 6 Levels”, 2019):<br>
                    Level 0: Human driver is responsible for all aspects of driving.<br>
                    Level 1: There is some driver assistance where the vehicle is capable of steering, acceleration, and breaking. However, the driver is still in control of all aspects of driving.<br>
                    Level 2: The vehicle can perform steering and acceleration at the same time. However, the driver still needs to be present and aware in order to respond if needed.<br>
                    Level 3: Similar to level 2, however the driver is not needed to monitor the situation. Level 3 still requires the driver to take back control if prompted.<br>
                    Level 4: Similar to level 3, however no driver is required even while the vehicle is in automated mode.<br> 
                    Level 5: The automated vehicle is in control always and can resolve failures within the system. A steering wheel is not required in Level 5 vehicles.</p>
                <p>As of 2021, a majority of vehicles that are currently on the road are only at level 1 or level 2 of automation (Dia, 2021). Technologies such as adaptive 
                    cruise control (Level 1) allows the vehicle to keep a safe distance from the car in front of them, however the human must continue to control the steering 
                    and breaking and remain alert as usual. Level 2 vehicles have this adaptive cruise control technology as well as autosteer, meaning multiple technologies 
                    are working together (“The 6 Levels”, 2019). Like Level 1, the driver will still need to remain focused and alert.</p>
                <p>The jump between Level 2 automation and Level 3 automation is seemingly quite a difficult one. Back in 2019, Audi announced they would release a Level 3 
                    autonomous vehicle featuring Traffic Jam Pilot. This would use a “lidar scanner with advanced sensor fusion and processing power” (“The 6 Levels”, 2019, para. 8). 
                    This would have meant that the driver could turn this on and essentially take their hands off the steering wheel. When the systems are unable to handle a situation, 
                    it will alert the driver and they will be able to take over control. Unfortunately, this was delayed as there was not enough legal framework to approve the functions 
                    of this Level 3 vehicle (Fung, 2020).</p>
                <p>Even Level 4 vehicles are already being tested. In Arizona, a Level 4 taxi service was unveiled. These self-driving vehicles had been tested for over a year, 
                    across 10 million miles! Magna, a Canadian automotive supplier has developed the technology allowing for Level 4 automation, but only on highway and urban 
                    environments (“The 6 Levels”, 2019).</p>
                <p>It is absolutely feasible that within the next few years, at least Level 3 autonomous vehicles will become more common on our roads. However, with this comes 
                    significant changes that are absolutely required to ensure the smooth transition to more autonomous systems.</p>
                <p>In order for autonomous vehicles to become commonplace, legislation needs to be discussed and created regarding the road safety, cyber security and data privacy. 
                    Consumers need to be sure that they are safe not only on the roads, but that their information is safe from potential hackers. There will need to be industry 
                    wide standards for the testing of autonomous vehicles in order to prove that these vehicles will keep the passenger safe and it can resolve any potential issue 
                    that could occur (Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>Currently, Norway has already implemented framework conditions for testing these vehicles, while Italy has already passed a law for these tests. 
                    This shows that some countries are taking steps in the right direction towards getting autonomous vehicles on the roads safely (Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>Level 3 autonomous vehicles are definitely on their way to coming onto the market. However, it will be quite a while before Level 4 and 5 vehicles are available to the 
                    public. Not necessarily due to a lack of technological capacity, but more from a lack of security and legislation protecting individual’s security.</p>
                <h2>What is the likely impact</h2>
                <p>As fully autonomous vehicles are introduced people will be able to use their travel time much more productively. Rather than focusing on the actual task of 
                    driving, the user can spend the travel time in conversation with other passengers, reading, preparing a presentation for work or school etc.</p>
                <p>If autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each other, it may allow the user to cut out delays in their travel times as traffic could run smoother. 
                    Without human error in the equation, there’s a potential for less traffic accidents.</p>
                <p>At the moment, some people rely on public transport to get them from home to work, or home to university, as more autonomous vehicles are brought in, 
                    more people may rely on this instead of a train or bus. For those working in the city, having an autonomous vehicle may mean they no longer have the 
                    need to search or pay for parking. They may even enjoy a reduced cost of fuel as they aren’t wasting it simply waiting in traffic (Pagano, 2020).</p>
                <p>Parents of school aged children may also find a great benefit in autonomous vehicles. No longer having the need to organise someone, or change their 
                    work schedule, in order to pick up their kids from school may allow comfort and convenience for the parent.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the implementation of autonomous vehicles will result in the loss of many jobs. Uber and taxi drivers may no longer be needed. 
                    Without the risk of human error, there is no need to pay other people to drive for you.</p>
                <p>As the automotive vehicle technology advances, public transport and freight trucks may become automated too. Train, bus, tram 
                    and truck drivers may find themselves without work as there is no longer a need for them. While this may allow for safer roads, 
                    it also means many people will be left without a job.</p>
                <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
                <p>For me personally, I would love to have an autonomous vehicle. I believe it would have a wonderful positive impact, not just for me 
                    personally, but also for the environment and safety on our roads. I love the idea of spending the time I take driving too and from 
                    work each day to do something productive. It would allow me to prepare myself better for work and take out the stress of driving each day.</p>
                <p>I’ve seen a lot of accidents almost happen where someone has pulled out into a busy intersection and only just missed the on-coming cars. 
                    I myself have almost been hit by drivers not paying attention to the road around them. Autonomous vehicles would take out the human error. 
                    Even when we are tired, we can still travel home with out worrying about driving and potentially crashing.</p>
                <p>However, I know this is not the case for all the people around me. As I was researching this topic, I spoke to my partner who is a 
                    mechanic and a massive car fanatic. While he would also be grateful to remove the human error, being able to drive cars himself is massively important to him.</p>
                <p>He has cars that he built himself and he’s described to me the feeling of pride that he gets when he can finally drive a car that he’s spent months, 
                    and in some cases years, building from scratch. As autonomous vehicles are introduced, it will make parts for his cars rarer, more expensive, 
                    and more difficult to find. It may mean car meets, where other car fanatics meet and show off their cars that they’ve built, become rarer or more exclusive. 
                    While the car community may not disappear, it may dramatically change. </p>
                <p>Driving cars also allows us to build skills such as perception and awareness to the environment around you. I do worry that without the need for driving, 
                    many of us will spend travel time on our phones and not paying attention to the world around us.</p>

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI (artificial intelligence). Which is the process that allows a computer to imitate the way humans are able to 
                    learn and gather information (Heath, 2020). What separates traditional programming and machine learning is that the computer is able to gather 
                    information and learn from experience without being directly instructed in where to find and gather data. Through machine learning a computer 
                    is capable of making accurate predictions and recognising patterns such as<br>• Image recognition (Guerrouj, 2020) – Being able to determine 
                    what object is inside of a photo. An example of image recognition in use is Google lens. Which is an application that is able to provide 
                    information of an object captured in a photo.<br>• Speech recognition (Guerrouj, 2020) – The ability to accurately recognise speech and 
                    also convert it to text. Speech recognition is already integrated with our everyday applications and products. We can see it in use 
                    through Apples AI-based voice assistant Siri, Googles voice search, Amazon Alexa and Microsoft teams live transcription.<br>• Customer support 
                    (Oberoi, 2017) – If you have had problems with your phone network or ISP, chances are you have used their live chat. It is difficult for a 
                    company to provide customer support 24 hours a day but with the help of machine learning you are able to receive a form of support. 
                    A chatbot can take your queries and provide you with the relevant information related to your problem.<br>• Fraud detection (Oberoi, 2017) 
                    – Machine learning is able to aid companies in detecting fraudulent activity. A company that uses machine learning for fraud detection is 
                    Capital One. A banking company that can detect and report fraudulent transactions.</p>
                <p>The future of machine learning is exciting. The possibilities are endless which can make one dive deep into a rabbit hole and think of 
                    the numerous capabilities of machine learning. One promising technology of machine learning has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    With the virus quickly spreading across the globe, pharmaceutical organisations were on the race to develop a vaccine to combat the virus.</p>
                <p>Traditionally a vaccine can take years to be developed and placed into trial before it can be released to the public. With the help of AI models, 
                    it was made possible to sift through the thousands of data about the virus to predict which proteins are most likely to develop an immune response 
                    (Hao, 2018), which made it possible to reduce the endless hours of research time by a significant margin.</p>
                <p>With the help of Baidu, a tech giant based in China. Medical research teams were able to find the secondary structure of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
                    sequence of the virus in 27 seconds which is 120 times fast than alternative methods (Hao, 2018). This is thanks to Baidu which lent their 
                    LinearFold AI algorithm to the medical research teams.</p>
                <p>The time reduced to develop a vaccine is not the only major milestone, with the help of Baidu’s AI algorithm the breakthrough was the development of 
                    messenger RNA vaccines. Originally vaccines would contain a portion of the virus which would prompt an immune response in humans. mRNA vaccines can teach 
                    the human body to develop proteins that can trigger an immune response to the virus without the need for a live strain (Greig, 2021).</p>
                <p>The development of mRNA vaccines has already opened the door to other promising vaccines that could aid in the fight against other diseases and 
                    research is already being conducted for HIV and cancer. One development that may be possible within the year is a booster shot for the mRNA vaccine 
                    (Grieg, 2021). Since the virus has been able to mutate it is vital to create a booster that combats variants of COVID-19.</p>
                <p>With machine learning in the root of the medical sector, it affects the whole industry and everyone in the public. Machine learning has changed the 
                    healthcare industry in ways where it can eliminate the time spent for doctors and researchers to find the underlying cause to problems, which will 
                    ultimately benefit the patient and people waiting for a cure to various illnesses. Other aspects that AI has or can be beneficial for healthcare are:<br>• Health Records 
                    (Bresnick, 2018) – Documenting and going through the data of patient records can be frustrating and time consuming which can cause limitations for a doctor. 
                    Fortunately, with the help of AI the process can be reduced and made to be time efficient.<br>•	Medical Imaging Diagnostics (Bresnick, 2018) – 
                    Doctors often have to rely on numerous methods such as CT scans, MRI’s and X-rays along with ultrasounds and biopsies in order to find the 
                    underlying cause of a patient’s illness. Introducing AI technologies to these systems provides a more accurate diagnosis. AI can rapidly 
                    go through medical images which compares them with abnormalities. AI can also predict a more accurate diagnosis to whether a cell may be cancerous or not.<br>•	Cancer treatment 
                    (Bresnick, 2018) – Similar to the way the mRNA vaccine works, immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that prompts a human’s immune system to beat tumours. 
                    The downside is that only a select few patients are able to respond to immunotherapy and medical professionals are not able identify which patients are 
                    eligible candidates. Promising machine learning technologies may make this possible in the future in the aid of identifying patients who will benefit from 
                    immunotherapy, by using the AI’s ability to sift through complex data of records and determine if the patient is eligible or not.</p>
                <p>There is fear within industries that automation and AI will make their jobs obsolete, their fears may be valid although it does not hold true to the 
                    healthcare industry (Spatharou, Hieronimus and Jenkins,2020). According to the AI company called Beyond Limits they believe “the role of AI is to complement, 
                    not replace, people by delivering actionable intelligence to human experts” (Edwards, 2018).</p>
                <p>Beyond Limits belief that AI would enhance human capabilities through analysing and processing the complex data is made valid with the evidence shown in 
                    today’s medical advancements (Edwards, 2018). Another way to think of it, is the AI does the hard and dirty work. Which gives humans the opportunity to 
                    put their time else where instead of wasting hours of going through the abundance of data.</p>
                <p>During the beginning of the COVID pandemic, I had a feeling of being lost and not knowing what was going to happen. All different stories coming from 
                    several sources, claiming that the virus was just like the flu, or that it was far deadlier, which created even more confusion. After a few months 
                    and hearing about vaccines being developed, it had eased that confusion and fear.</p>
                <p>The rapid development of the vaccine piqued my interest, which led me to start reading online about the technology behind the development. 
                    I was surprised to find that machine learning played a key role for the time frame of the vaccines to be created.</p>
                <p>With all the advancements in the health industry that machine learning has assisted, I am more confident in knowing that the technology is there or 
                    close to preventing illnesses. As machine learning continues to innovate modern medical technology, it can also eliminate the fear in people and 
                    bring hope that there is a cure or help that will be beneficial for them with anything they are suffering from.</p>
                <p>As stated above, machine learning has already made an impact in not just my life but also with everyone else during this pandemic. 
                    From being in lockdown and not being able to see family and friends, we are now slowly able to get back to normal life thanks to modern technology. 
                    It brings me excitement to see what innovation machine learning can bring us in the future, not just in the health care industry but all the other 
                    industries where AI and machine learning is making a difference.</p>

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>Cloud computing as officially defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reads: “Cloud computing is a model for 
                    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 
                    (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management 
                    effort or service provider interaction” (Mell & Grance, 2011). What does this mean to the home computer user? Well cloud computing is the 
                    ability to access the internet anywhere, anytime and use the resources, data and applications you need without the requirement of 
                    understanding the technology.</p>
                <p><img src="CloudcomputingOne.PNG" alt="Picture has a table of information about cloud computing"><P>Cloud computing has taken the traditional 
                    data centre and on-premises corporate functionality and made these accessible, financially and physically, to any user.</P></p>
                <P>On-demand self service enables consumers to provision or de-provision services offered by cloud vendors as and when required to meet consumer needs, 
                    without the delay of going through the provider. Broad network access is the connectivity to the services being consumed, this is usually through 
                    high bandwidth internet services into a cloud provider, however, could also be on a Local Area Network (LAN) in the event of a private cloud. 
                    Resource pooling or multi-tenancy provides financial benefits to consumers by allowing the same hardware resources to be accessed by multiple consumers, 
                    reducing costs to the consumer. Rapid elasticity takes on-demand self service and enables the growth or reduction of cloud services based on demand 
                    or pre-determined events. Measured service is the way that the cloud provider determines the cost for a defined period. Cloud services are a “pay 
                    for what you use” basis, this means that the other four characteristics will determine the costs for the consumer, this could be an annual, monthly, 
                    weekly, daily, hourly, minute or second charge.</P>
                <P>Traditional corporate ICT systems involve large investment in hardware (servers, storage and network), data centre services to host 
                    the hardware or configuration of on-premises rooms to accommodate the hardware and the personnel to manage and maintain the hardware. 
                    When you have the hardware assembled and managed you then need teams to provision and maintain the applications that the corporation 
                    utilises and platform(s) that the application reside on.</P>
                <P>The service models with cloud computing take these three areas and reduce the management overheads with the associated service offered. 
                    Cloud providers use secure data centres to provision hardware, consumers are then able to use this hardware as IaaS, negating the 
                    requirement to procure hardware. This is extremely advantageous for small and start-up companies that do not have the financial equity 
                    to make an investment in hardware. With IaaS consumers do not get access to hardware this is fully maintained by the cloud provider 
                    and the consumer is responsible to maintain the platform and applications required. PaaS further reduces the management overhead for 
                    companies by providing the platform, or operating environment required for the applications the company uses. PaaS is used by application 
                    development teams to reduce the overhead of providing a consistent and up-to-date environment and smaller companies to remove the ICT 
                    management overheads. SaaS provides applications over the internet, usually for a subscription fee. SaaS applications can be used in corporate 
                    environments, smaller companies and individuals. SaaS has enabled expensive and complex to manage applications to be available to all consumers, 
                    including individuals for education and learning.</P>
                <P><img src="CloudcomputingTwo.PNG" alt="Picture of a table that contains information about cloud computing"></P>
                <P>Cloud computing has reached into all aspects of life, early adopters have been education, social media, entertainment, navigation, 
                    personal storage, online shopping and online gaming/gambling. The current cloud computing concept has been around since the early 
                    2000’s, but what's ultimately driving the public cloud adoption are this ease-of-use, flexibility. More control around what you consume, 
                    and when you consume it, and how you consume it (McDonough, 2018)</P>
                <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <P>As more services move to a cloud based delivery model the consumer will need to attain faster and more reliable internet connections. 
                    The cloud is driving mobility and flexible working conditions, companies are now able to make remote and collaborative working better 
                    for employees. The employment market has changed to enable companies to employ staff with the right skillsets not necessarily in the 
                    immediate vicinity, but now anywhere in the world. This flows into the local community with greater investment in small retail businesses 
                    that might historically rely on seasonal trade or lower income community members.</P>
                <P>Companies are changing the way that they deliver services to employees, 81 percent of companies with 1,000 employees or more have a
                     multi-platform strategy. The number is to rise to more than 90 percent by 2024 (Saleem, 2020). As the understanding of what the cloud 
                     can offer grows, companies are more willing to embrace the change and put more services online.</P>
                <P>Some growth areas that have seen changes due to the cloud are quantum computing, automation and Internet of Things (IoT). 
                    Quantum computers are now available via cloud services and are enabling research labs and think tanks to process complex 
                    algorithm calculations and process massive datasets in quick time. Financial institutions can process transactions faster, 
                    encryption algorithms are able to be processed faster meaning transactions are more secure. The cloud has seen an increase in 
                    automation for business processes, support systems are more stable and consistent allowing businesses to reduce errors and increase 
                    productivity.</P>
                <P>Today just about anything can be connected to the internet, these devices comprise the IoT. These could be refrigerators, 
                    televisions, washing machines, wearable devices, lightbulbs, house locks or security cameras, these connected devices are 
                    enabling people to be more efficient and safer. The IoT devices need to be registered to a cloud service and this cloud service 
                    is how the consumer can interact with them. This could be in a private cloud in the personal home or in a managed online service 
                    with data analytics being conducted. This online capability is what has seen some security issues raised regarding IoT as some services 
                    have not had adequate security procedures built into the offering and devices and have been remotely controlled or personal 
                    data has been exposed.</P>
                <P>Due to the way that traditional IT systems were built and supported there has not been a downturn in employment with the uptake of cloud services. 
                    Roles of the workforce have changed however, and employees are having to learn new skills to adapt to the changing landscape.</P>
                <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
                <p>The cloud has had a significant impact on my daily life. While I have adapted to the use of mobile devices, streaming services 
                    and stopped using my wallet to carry identification and currency, my career has seen the largest change.</p>
                <p>Staying abreast of emerging technologies is an important part of working in the ICT industry however, the adoption of 
                    cloud services is no different and I have had to learn new skills to ensure that I am able to provide relevant skills to my employer.</p>
                <p>Having two young children and watching them grow up with the current technology available, I feel that it is necessary I ensure that they 
                    have a good understanding of IT systems, security and privacy. It is important for them to know that once something is online or in the cloud, 
                    there is no way to get it back out and you no longer have control over who may be able to access this data. For me this is the most important 
                    fact that people do not understand regarding the cloud.</p>

                    <h1 class="pi_title">Overview</h1>
                    <p class="pi_para">Ice Scream is a 2D platformer developed with Unity. The game is focused around our main
                        protagonist, a frightened ice cream who was accidentally dropped by the local ice cream
                        man and now needs to make it back to the fridge before he melts. The world is a very
                        hostile place for our poor little ice cream. The hot sun is beaming down towards earth and
                        is rapidly melting our hero. In order to survive they must navigate through the environment
                        by conquering increasingly difficult obstacles. They also have to contend with the hungry
                        neighbourhood children and their vicious dogs, who want nothing more than to eat him up.
                        During this journey they will meet other weird and wonderful characters that could help or
                        hinder our heroes journey back to the safety of the fridge.
                        Given the scope of the project - a realistic goal would be to achieve a playable demo or
                        alpha build rather than a fully developed game that is ready to ship. Demonstrating the
                        games core mechanics and features on a smaller scale. Due to time constraints and our
                        overall skill level, I think this would be the best approach.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pi_column">
                    <h1 class="pi_title">Description</h1>
                    <p class="pi_para">The main feature of the game would be that it is a 2D platformer. The Player would move
                        from point A to Point B to progress to the level. The player would control the characters
                        movements through the level, avoiding hazards and obstacles with the goal of reaching
                        safety before you melt! The levels would have puzzle-like elements that become harder as
                        you progress to keep them interesting and challenging. The main element of danger would
                        be from the sun’s rays. Whenever the character is in direct sunlight, it will damage the
                        player's health. Too much sun and the player will die. That's where shade comes in. Shade
                        would play a big part in the game's mechanics as it would be the only place the player
                        could stand without taking damage from the sun. Shaded areas would be limited to keep
                        the level challenging.
                        Along with the dangers, there would also be elements in the game that would help the
                        player achieve his goal. For example, collecting ice cubes would slow down the melting
                        mechanic by replenishing the player's health and liquid chocolate would form a protective
                        helmet that would protect the character from the sun's rays or other hazards.
                        The art style would be colourful and vibrant. The world is filled with bizarre and wonderful
                        characters. Below is a rough sketch of the main character. Giving a good indication of the
                        art style.</p>

                    <p class="pi_para">During the current restrictions imposed on many people around the world, due to Covid 19,
                        home entertainment has boomed. More and more people are enjoying gaming and it is no
                        longer considered something only a small percentage of the population enjoy.
                        It is amazing to see technology come together to create amazing works of art.
                        Game development is an exciting, challenging and entertaining way to develop skills as a
                        programmer or artist. The skills you could learn from developing a game could also be
                        interchangeable within the industry. Such as programming, time management, team work
                        etc.
                        Troncoso (May 2021, para 10) mentions in a recent article posted on Dynamic Business,
                        “Australia’s gaming industry was one of the few industries that managed to find success
                        during the pandemic, growing to $3.4 billion in 2020 – around a 6 per cent jump from the
                        year prior.”
                        Gaming is bigger than it's ever been, along with the skills you could learn, there is also the
                        chance you could make good money from a successful title.</p>

                    <p class="pi_para"><h2>Engine</h2>The engine is a crucial piece of software that is needed to create a game. 
                        It consists of multiple components, all operating together. Below I will outline some of the main components of an engine.<br><b>Physics Engine:</b> The engine will have its own set of rules to generate physical laws within the environment such as gravity and 
                        also gives you the ability to manipulate these forces.<br><b>Rendering Engine:</b> Generates images 
                        from either a 2D or 3D model.<br><b>Audio Engine:</b> This offers you the framework to add and edit audio.<br>There are a number of game engines 
                        available out there. The majority of them are free for personal use but when it comes to<br> revenue and publishing that's where cost becomes a factor. Below I have listed 
                        some of the more well known ones and compared them.</p>
                        <p><h2>Unity</h2>Developed by Unity Technologies</p>
                    <div class="pi_column3">
                        <p id=><h2>Pros</h2><br>- Unity offers the option to develop both 2D and 3D projects.<br>- Develop for multiple platforms such as PC, Mobile, Xbox, Playstation etc.<br>
                        - Beginner friendly.<br>- Free to publish as long as you are not generating over $100,000 annually.<br>- Active community and lots of tutorials on youtube.<br>- Asset store containing lots of free assets.<br>
                        - Student developers pack is available for free.<br>- Uses C# scripting. Considered a beginner friendly language.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pi_column3">
                        <p><h2>Cons</h2><br>- The whole Unity package is quite large in size, around 9GB.<br>- They don't offer any grants to indie developers, while other game engine developers do.<br>- Once you exceed the $100,000 
                            annual revenue, a subscription or license is required. </p>
                    </div>
                    <P><h2>Unreal</h2>Developed by Epic Games</P>
                    <div class="pi_column4">
                        <p><h2>Pros</h2><br>- Considered the more powerful engine when it comes to high quality graphics. A lot of AAA studios use this engine because of this reason.<br>- Open-source is considered an advantage because it makes 
                            development easier.<br>- Unreal engine has great performance and uses less memory and resources.<br>- Has a wide range of built in tools that would require coding in other engines. Ie Visual editors.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pi_column4">
                        <p><h2>Cons</h2><br>- Once you begin making money on your product you pay a 5% royalty on the amounts after the first $3000 per product per calendar quarter.<br>- Small but more curated asset store.<br>- Not suitable 
                            for small games. 
                            Typically used for studios with big budgets.<br>- Smaller community<br>- Uses C++ which is considered a difficult language to learn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p><h2>Gamemaker studio 2</h2>Developed by YoYo Games</p>
                    <div class="pi_column6">
                        <p><h2>Pros</h2><br>- Good for quickly prototyping a project<br>- User friendly interface<br>- Large community offering lots of tutorials<br>- Good documentation</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pi_column6">
                        <p><h2>Cons</h2><br>- Expensive. You need to pay per platform and on top of that you need to pay $800 annually for each platform you publish on.<br>- Uses its own language called GML which is known for 
                            teaching bad coding habits, along with not being able to transfer those skills to other languages.<br>- Does not have great support from the developers as they are 
                            a small team. Bug fixes can take a very long time to be ironed out.<br>- Reported as being unstable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>After careful consideration - Unity is still the preferred Engine for developing this project. As outlined above, Unity offers a lot for free.<br> 
                        It has a great community, lots of tutorials and support, is multi platform and even offers free high quality assets for students.<br> 
                        It seems like the most logical choice and the pros far outweigh the cons. </p>

                        <p>The minimum system requirements are not very demanding, however the performance and rendering will rely on your hardware so the better it is the smoother 
                            the experience. Being a 2D game it won't be very demanding. Although most people already have some sort of PC.  Below I have created a system build that 
                            would be more than enough to develop a 2D game</p>

                        <h2>IDE/Text Editor</h2>
                        <p>An IDE would be required for writing scripts. Finding one with support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git, would be helpful in the development process. 
                            Some notable text editors are:<br>
                            VS Code<br>
                            Sublime Text Editor<br>

                        <h2>Recording DAW</h2>
                        <p>If we went down the path of recording our own audio for voice overs, sound effects and music, a digital audio workstation would be required. This is optional as there are a countless amount of free sound effects online and the need for voice overs is completely optional. Voice over work could be something that would be implemented once most of development has been completed. 
                            There are lots of free options out there such as:<br>
                            Garageband<br>
                            Audacity<br>
                            Cakewalk<br>
                            There are also paid DAW’s that you can get restricted versions of for free such as Pro Tools.</p>

                        <p>Krita is a free open source program that can be used to design artwork for the game.
                            There are paid alternatives out there such as Photoshop that offer a student discount.</p>

                            The RODE NT1-a is an excellent microphone and would be very suitable for what is required.</p>

                            A very basic one is required as only 1 sound source would be recorded at a time, reducing the need for an expensive unit with multiple inputs.</p>

                    <h1 class="pi_title">Cost & Funding</h1>
                    <p class="pi_para">Undertaking game development can be quite costly if you don’t already own some of the basic equipment required such as a modern computer. 
                        As the computer itself would be your biggest expense, the other requirements can be quite inexpensive or have free alternatives.</p>
                    <p>As for funding A prototype would need to be developed in order to generate funding. This would mean taking the demo and making it a completely polished, 
                        bit size chuck of the game, that is the best representation of the product so that it can be sent to publishers to try and secure funding for full development. 
                        By sending the prototype to publishers you could get some great early feedback and see if there is any interest in the project. If there is interest, 
                        it would mean that you are onto something that publishers believe they/you could make money from. This is also a great way of seeing if what you are working 
                        on is worth developing further. Even small games can take years to complete, so by getting feedback early on it could save you years of development on a project 
                        that no one is interested in. An alternative to publisher funding, you could start a crowdfunding page to generate revenue. By offering contributors different 
                        rewards tiers depending on how much they contribute to the project. A great example of crowdfunding is the game Shenmue 3. The developers were able to generate 
                        6.3 million from fans of the previous games in the series. This demonstrates that if your game captures interest within the gaming community, there is the 
                        potential to generate enough funding to complete the project.</p>

                    <h1 class="pi_title">Skills Required</h1>
                    <p class="pi_para">Because the project is focused on developing a demo, rather than a complete game, with a lot of hard work it could be achieved. 
                        A few rough edges are to be expected and usually forgiven in an alpha build and those things can be refined later on.
                        The biggest hurdle would be time restraints and lack of game development experience. I’ve outlined below what would 
                        be required to get the project off the ground.</p>
                    <p class="pi_para">The first skill required would be the ability to use Unity Editor. The bulk of the workload would be done in unity so 
                        familiarity with the program is a must. Unity has become very popular in the last few years and more and more people are using it.</p>
                    <p class="pi_para">A basic understanding of C# would be helpful as Unity’s scripts are written in C#. However, 
                        Unity’s asset store has so many free assets available. Because of this,  the game could be created with very minimal coding. Assets like 
                        player controllers scripts and art packs are readily available for free on the asset store.</p>
                    <p class="pi_para">Technical ability and resources may be lacking to achieve a professional looking product that could be used to acquire funding. 
                        Focusing on the game mechanics and making the game feel as enjoyable as possible would be paramount to securing these funds. 
                        Once all the game mechanics are polished and working well, the art work would become the main focus. Placeholder art work could be 
                        used during development to speed up the process.</p>
                    <p class="pi_para">Music production software would also be required if the games music and sound effects were to be created. Otherwise there are free 
                        music and sound effects available online.<br>Writing would also be a desirable skill. A strong narrative would help draw the player in 
                        and make them want to explore the world.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="pi_column5">
                   <h1 class="pi_title">Approach to Development</h1>
                   <p class="pi_para">Given that we all have varying levels of experience with game development, the best approach would be to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each group member 
                       and make a plan based on those skills. The group members who are already familiar with using the Unity editor should focus on the development of the game 
                       itself, i.e. the code, game functionality and piecing it all together. Other members would focus their attention on project management, creating/gathering 
                       assets like sound effects, music, background art, character art etc. All group members would be involved in the testing and overall quality assurance of the product.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="pi_column5">
                    <h1 class="pi_title">Outcome</h1>
                    <p class="pi_para">If the project is successful it would lay the groundwork for what could potentially be a fully developed game. The outcome would be a fully 
                        functioning, 2D platformer demo with all the game mechanics and features working smoothly. Giving the player a good insight into the direction the game is 
                        heading. Because the team is interested in exploring game development, this is the ultimate way to get exposure. Shedding light on the amount of work and 
                        effort required to develop a game. Building a game is a great team project and would help develop some essential skills required to work in the industry.</p>
