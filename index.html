                        Some of my hobbies include composing music, gaming, and game dev. I’ve always been interested in IT from a young age but up until now 
                        have never pursued it as a career. I'm hoping my education at RMIT and participation in our group Night Owls project will give me the skills required

                        I was born in Australia but come from a Filipino background. I love to play games and find myself playing counter strike a bit too much. 
                        I previously studied Nursing but realised it wasn't the field for me. I've always had an interest in IT mainly the programming side 
                        which ultimately lead to making the decision to study Information and Technology.</p>

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that currently equips machines with 
                    the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human all languages. It combines the field of linguistics and 
                    computer science to decipher language structure guidelines and to make models which can comprehend, break down and separate 
                    significant details from text and speech. Humans interact with each other on a daily basis, for example over social media platforms, 
                    transferring large quantities of freely available data to each other. This data is extremely useful for NLP in understanding human behaviors 
                    and the habits of its customers.</p>
                <p>Most recently, data analysts tend to use the entirety of this data to give machines the ability to mimic human communication behaviors. 
                    This currently saves companies a significant amount of man power and time, as they no longer need to have a person present at the other end 
                    of the phone to be able to assist a customer with an issue. NLP can be applied every day in many different situations, for example when you are 
                    unsure of the spelling of a certain word, Autocorrect steps in to resolve this issue in a very convenient manner. Additionally, if a term paper was 
                    flagged for potential plagiarism, there are a vast number of online plagiarism checkers that can check for matches with your documents from all over the web.</p>
                <p>Future directions of this field of technology include:
                    <br> - Enhanced interpretability (Zhang et al., 2021): this development is becoming increasingly important as technology generates more complex models and programs. 
                    Interpretability allows computers to effectively analyse and evaluate models for specific purposes. 
                    <br> - Emotional detection and conveyance (Strapparava, 2016): the ability to interpret and convey emotion can facilitate the human connection aspect of this technology. 
                    As the basic purpose of NLP is to derive meaning in human communication, the ability to evaluate syntactic and semantic features will be enhanced with this additional layer 
                    of consideration. For example, emotions can impact on more subtle aspects of communication, such as implied meanings and sarcasm. 
                    <br> - Clinical applications in medicine (Nehme & Feldman, 2020): This is an exciting direction that will likely develop a major role in different medical industries. 
                    This paper illustrated an early example, where NLP is being used to facilitate the translation of research to clinic practice in the field of gastroenterology, in particular 
                    for complex surgical procedures.</p> 
                <p>There are several important advances in technology that have enabled NLP in the past, and will continue to support its evolution:
                    <br> - Word-sense disambiguation – being able to discern the sense of a word, as it is used in a particular sentence. This has implications for discourse and the relevance of search engines.  
                    <br> - Part of speech tagging Parsing – to analyse the grammar, speech and syntactic relations in a sentence, as well as being able to describe a word in the sentence. 
                    <br> - Spam detection – a series of filters are used to generate a binary classification of emails as relevant or spam, and consequently being able to direct them into a spam folder. 
                    <br> - Sentiment detection – this form of analysis is a foundational component of natural language processing, and enables a computer to be able to identify and extract opinions within any given text. 
                    <br> - Named entity recognition – this process enables a computer to detect any important names (for people, organisations, brands etc) that are mentioned in a text, and thus be able to sort additional 
                    information into relevant and extraneous streams. 
                    <br> - Coreference resolution – Finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a string of text (e.g., identifying the named subject and any further referents via the use of pronouns)
                    <br> - Question-answering Information extraction – there are several approaches to this component, including knowledge based and information retrieval based processes. These paradigms allow a computer 
                    to analyse the question, retrieve any relevant information and generate appropriate answers 
                    <br> - Dialogue – these systems function to enable conversation with humans, as they employ one of various communication modes on both input and output channels
                    <br> - Machine translation – being able to automatically convert one natural language into another, whilst avoiding any deviations in the semantics features of the text 
                    <br> - Paraphrasing and summarising technology – this is a discourse level of analysis, that requires in-depth analysis of text components and overall main ideas (Ferrari, 2018).</p>
                <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <p>A large recent impact of NLP has been in its involvement in COVID-19. With the world plunged into a worldwide pandemic, there has been immense documentation regarding the spread of the virus, diagnosis 
                    and testing procedures/protocols. With a vast increase in use of medical terminology by the media, and in all the documentation of COVID-19, NLP has been used to update the public’s understanding of the 
                    current risks and restrictions.</p>
                <p>Health care workers have been required to complete additional tasks in their practices, including the documentation of patient personal details and implementation of other government mandated protocols 
                    (such as use of QR codes). The extraction of this information supports the government to achieve quality reporting, risk stratification, medical necessity reviews and predictive analyses.</p>
                <p>Clinical NLP is a specialization of NLP that allows computers to understand the rich meaning that lies behind a doctor's written analysis of a patient. Wolters Kluwer’s Clinical NLP is one of many CNLP 
                    that optimizes and accelerates medical record reviews.</p>
                <p>With the ever-evolving nature of natural language processing it will only continue to grow and become more advanced as we as do as a society. With this will bring new jobs in sectors such as data analysis, 
                    computer scientists and even potentially more linguistic based jobs, such as speech pathologists, by increasing our own understanding of language.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, these developments will also likely make many jobs redundant, such as company helpline centres. There are many jobs and services that may have previously been accepted as requiring a 
                    human to manage the responsibilities, however this may be changing as computers are becoming increasingly able to analyse patterns in and imitate human behaviours. NLP appears to be breaching the barrier 
                    between human services and computer services, and therefore impacting our understanding of what it means to be human.</p>
                <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
                <p>As described above, NLP has vast and significant impacts in our world today. It has integrated into many aspects of our lives, practically every aspect that is already influenced by digital technology. 
                    NLP has made most forms of technology more accessible to the public, especially those who are less familiar or confident with using technology. For many older men and women, digital technology is a 
                    foreign and challenging concept, and they often ask for help in setting up and using new devices. However, as NLP has generated software like Siri, older generations are often able to ask questions 
                    and comprehend the more accessible language used to navigate new devices.</p>
                <p>NLP also enables easier access to troubleshooting pages. For example, when my grandmother first started using her iPad, she accidentally changed the language and couldn’t figure out how to change 
                    it back to English. Being unfamiliar with how settings usually works, she relied on Siri to change the language.</p>
                <p>For me personally, I use social media for many different purposes, including social relationships, updates on news events, and learning new skills through video tutorials. NLP is evident in 
                    a number of functions on Facebook. For example, when searching for a friend or a particular group, I can enter a relevant word and Facebook is able to find semantically related name to 
                    match my search. It is also commonly understood that social media platforms process any information we provide and analyse to form an online profile that generates content that is 
                    targeted towards our interests and demographic.</p>

                        neighbourhood children and their vicious dogs, who want nothing more than to eat him up.
                        During this journey they will meet other weird and wonderful characters that could help or
                        hinder our heroes journey back to the safety of the fridge.
                        Given the scope of the project - a realistic goal would be to achieve a playable demo or
                        alpha build rather than a fully developed game that is ready to ship. Demonstrating the
                        games core mechanics and features on a smaller scale. Due to time constraints and our
                        overall skill level, I think this would be the best approach.</p>

                    <p class="pi_para">The main feature of the game would be that it is a 2D platformer. The Player would move
                        from point A to Point B to progress to the level. The player would control the characters
                        movements through the level, avoiding hazards and obstacles with the goal of reaching
                        safety before you melt! The levels would have puzzle-like elements that become harder as
                        you progress to keep them interesting and challenging. The main element of danger would
                        be from the sun’s rays. Whenever the character is in direct sunlight, it will damage the
                        player's health. Too much sun and the player will die. That's where shade comes in. Shade
                        would play a big part in the game's mechanics as it would be the only place the player
                        could stand without taking damage from the sun. Shaded areas would be limited to keep
                        the level challenging.
                        Along with the dangers, there would also be elements in the game that would help the
                        player achieve his goal. For example, collecting ice cubes would slow down the melting
                        mechanic by replenishing the player's health and liquid chocolate would form a protective
                        helmet that would protect the character from the sun's rays or other hazards.
                        The art style would be colourful and vibrant. The world is filled with bizarre and wonderful
                        characters. Below is a rough sketch of the main character. Giving a good indication of the
                        art style.</p>

                    <p class="pi_para">During the current restrictions imposed on many people around the world, due to Covid 19,
                        home entertainment has boomed. More and more people are enjoying gaming and it is no
                        longer considered something only a small percentage of the population enjoy.
                        It is amazing to see technology come together to create amazing works of art.
                        Game development is an exciting, challenging and entertaining way to develop skills as a
                        programmer or artist. The skills you could learn from developing a game could also be
                        interchangeable within the industry. Such as programming, time management, team work
                        etc.
                        Troncoso (May 2021, para 10) mentions in a recent article posted on Dynamic Business,
                        “Australia’s gaming industry was one of the few industries that managed to find success
                        during the pandemic, growing to $3.4 billion in 2020 – around a 6 per cent jump from the
                        year prior.”
                        Gaming is bigger than it's ever been, along with the skills you could learn, there is also the
                        chance you could make good money from a successful title.</p>
